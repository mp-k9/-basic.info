↦ hello! my names are metta, redstone, or whatever else you know me as (old names, rp names, etc etc)

↦ my pronouns are he/xe/it/vir, plus some other stuff if we are close (this only applies to maybe 3 people) but he/him is acceptable if thats confusing for whatever reason.

↦ i identify as non-binary and i am on the aroace spectrum. i am fairly sex and romance repulsed, please DO NOT FLIRT with me. i am also otherkin and a yumeshipper. my identities are heavily influenced by my audhd, primarily my autism. ask me about these things! i love explaining them :)

↦ i have social anxiety and i'm not good with new people. i usually stick close to one or two people, often my online sibling. if i mess up a social interaction somehow, please let me know! i also zone out a lot and get distracted, partly because of my adhd and partly because i just dissociate a lot. if i miss something, i promise i'm not being rude, i probably was just not looking at my screen!
